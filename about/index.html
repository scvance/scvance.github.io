          <p>TL;DR here's my <a href="/sam-vance-resume.pdf">resume</a></p>
          <p>
            My name is Sam Vance, I am 22 years old and finishing my undergraduate at BYU! I am studying 
            Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and a minor in Mathematics. I am hoping to get into a Master's or 
            PhD program to continue my studies, with the goal of entering industry creating RL algorithms for robotics applications.
            Outside of school I love to rock climb (I climb v8/9 and ~5.13a indoors), play the piano, sketch, build robots, 
            and I am actually starting some Bonsai Trees. Cross your fingers for me. I am creating this website as 
            a place to showcase some of the projects that I have been working on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been building robotics projects for several years now, and never really had an effective way to showcase them. I tried to do TikTok for a while, 
            and I may get back into making videos, but videos take a long time to make, and an even longer time to make them engaging. Also frankly, it is hard to 
            have a tight enough publishing schedule to build an audience, so for now TikTok has taken a back seat. I have a lot of projects that I 
            have built and will be adding them to this website as I have time to do so. For now I have a few of my favorites up here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the projects page just shows some photos and videos that I have taken of the projects, along with a little bit of technical information about them.
            In the future, I plan to add more detailed information including CAD files, code, and more detailed descriptions of the projects. Hopefully if people are interested,
            this website will be a good resource to get started with some robotics projects.
