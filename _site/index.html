          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>Sam Vance is a passionate robotics enthusiast and aspiring engineer, currently developing a set of humanoid robotic legs. Hailing from Idaho Falls, Sam developed an early fascination with engineering, driven by his goal to one day build a bionic eye. Inspired by figures like Mark Rober, he has committed himself to advancing in the fields of robotics, AI, and mechanical design.</p>
          <p>Among Sam's various projects include a self-playing flute, an AI-powered light-painting robot, a self-driving car, and a drone with obstacle avoidanceâ€”each self-designed, from robotic design to coding to 3D printing parts to creating custom PCB circuit boards. His technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java, and he has significant experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Sam has also contributed to advanced NLP research, configured high-performance computing environments, and developed multi-agent LLM workflows.</p>
          <p>With an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a 4.0 GPA from BYU, Sam has set his sights on pursuing graduate studies in robotics control. His ultimate goal remains to be part of the team that makes breakthroughs in prosthetic technology, particularly in developing the bionic eye, an ambition fueled by both his technical expertise and personal inspiration.</p>
